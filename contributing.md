# Can I Contribute?

Yes you can!  
**Adding a package **
*through a pull request* : If you have an package that describes a fictional universe and it is accesable through R, 
click on `readme.md` and then `Edit this file`. Make your changes and send the pull request. If I'm ok with it, I'll merge your
changes. 

*with an issue*: if you don't know if a package qualifies, or you don't know how to work with pull requests [open an issue](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/rfictionaldatasets/issues/new).

**Typos, spelling and grammar**
I am a horrible writer, but I'm willing to learn, so please change spelling if something isn't correct. I don't mind, really. 

**Any other way **
Sure!
