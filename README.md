# A list of fictional universes available from within R. 
Notes: a * means that the package is in beta.


This is meant to be a list of packages and datasets available to R-users, to qualify a dataset or package needs to be available 
to R-users with `devtools::install_github()` or `install.packages()` AND needs to be about a fictional universe. 

I try to put it in alphabetical order.
